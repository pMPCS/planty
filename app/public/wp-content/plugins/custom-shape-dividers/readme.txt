== Description ==

 I created this free tool to make it easier for designers and non designers to use a beautiful SVG shape divider for their latest project. We hope you enjoy this tool.

 Our Shape Dividers are premade SVG shapes that are not dynamic to the settings you use on the toolbar. Every Shape exported will come out as per it's original design and is manipulated via the code you export with it and implement into your web build.
