== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you read my replies? =

Heck nah! No one likes peepers. All submissions are saved in your WordPress database or sent to your inbox.

Note: you'll need to upgrade to our paid contact form builder plugin to get some of the best goodies mentioned here.

= Can I translate forms into my language? =

Absolutely! Every last word read by your submitters can be translated ‚Äî just type and replace. No extra plugins. No code changes. No fuss.

= Is my data safe? Is Happyforms HIPAA compliant? =

Our competitors claim to be HIPAA compliant, but that‚Äôs misleading. Those dodgy buggers! Why have a compliant form if your site‚Äôs server, connected services and chosen inbox aren‚Äôt?

To keep things simple, we say to disable Happyforms from saving submissions and instead point replies to an email address hosted by an end-to-end encrypted email service like ProtonMail.

It‚Äôs easier than it sounds. Promise. Hit us up if you have questions.

= Does it work on a site not using WordPress? =

Nope. Sorry! We‚Äôre for all things WordPress ‚Äòround here.

Nope. Happyforms has a fancy drag-n-drop form builder. But if you find yourself needing to code something, email us. We can help you out with the nerdy stuff.

= Does Happyforms work on all devices? =

Yep! We always recommend building forms on a desktop, but you can fill out a form anywhere ‚Äî mobile, tablet and desktop.

Sadly no longer compatible with your 90s Tamagotchi.

Yep! Happyforms directly connects with reCaptcha, Google Analytics, ActiveCampaign, AWeber, Constant Contact, ConvertKit, Mailchimp, MailerLite, MailPoet, SendFox, SendGrid, Sendinblue, Stripe, PayPal, Zapier, Integrately and Integromat.
